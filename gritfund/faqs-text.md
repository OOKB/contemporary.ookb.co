## FAQ’s 

##### How much funding can I request for my project?
You may request any amount between $1000 and $6000.

##### Can the Grit Fund be used to fund part of a larger project?
No. The Grit Fund does not partially fund larger projects. 

##### While my group is not a 501(c)3, nonprofit organization, I want to work with an organization that is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Is my project still eligible for funding?
Only artist initiated projects are eligible for funding. This does not necessary preclude your working with a nonprofit, such as the use of their facilities for a performance or event. However, the Grit Fund is not intended to cover production costs that should be covered by an established organization as a part of their regular program. 

##### Can I apply for a grant to acquire equipment?
Equipment purchase or rental can be included as an expense as a part of a larger project. You may not apply for a grant with the sole purpose of acquiring equipment.

Yes. Examples of general operating costs associated with the launch of a new arts space or the support of an existing arts space include: rent, utilities, artist and designer fees, administrative fees, supplies, and equipment. 

##### Can I include artist fees, stipends, or honoraria in my budget to compensate participants, collaborators and/or myself? 
Yes.

##### Who should be listed as the lead organizer?

##### Do you have to be a U.S. citizen to apply?
No. However, the lead organizer must have a social security number to receive payment of the award. Additional collaborators do not need to be U.S. citizens or have social security numbers.
